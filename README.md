## api-for-mean-stack

#This is a Api that I built for a angular admin panel. This api is built with Nodejs,ExpressJs, and Mongo Db.

#It has routes for getting users , deleting users, user registration, and admin routes.

#It also has middlewares for verifying jwt tokens and uses helmet js for api security.

#Im still working on this api as I continue working on my angular application so this api will be continued to be updated while I keep working on my angular application.
